                <p>
                    <h2>Intro</h2>
                    Once upon a time, just beyond the coastal vastness of the deep blue, lies many undersea villages<br />
                    And in these ocean villages are the fantastical Fish Folk.<br />
                    Fish folk are Human-like people who evolved from their aquatic ancestors<br />
                    Not just fish too, the various sea inhabitants have also grown and evolved as well<br />
                    The many creatures of the sea and Fish Folk have lived in harmony for many millennia, peacefully minding their own business away from the surface dwellers<br />
                    <br />
                    In the humble town of Umi Village is a local hermit crab named Dross<br />
                    Now, you see here, Dross is kind of a lazy bum, often considered worthless among the Fish Folk of the village<br />
                    However, he loves collecting useless trinkets from the surface world.<br />
                    One peaceful day, a bunch of mysterious objects fell from above, polluting and damaging the surrounding areas of Umi Village<br />
                    Seeing this as a chance to look for potential treasure among the heap<br />
                    Dross grabs his metal detector from one of his trips on the surface, using it to detect stuff such as metal and plastic (don’t question it)<br />
                    Dross now embarks on his quest to hopefully find something treasure worthy and get rich.<br />
                    So he can finally get the praise and recognition he deserves.<br />
                    <br />

                    <h2>Level 1 Beginning</h2> <br />
                    #name Dross #sprite normal<br />
                    Alright, time to look for that treasure.<br />
                    #name Dross #sprite sad<br />
                    Though, I just bolted out of the village without thinking where to go.<br />
                    Where even am I? I do recall some things falling in this area, though none of this looks familiar to me.<br />
                    #name Dross #sprite normal<br />
                    Hopefully I’m not too far off from town.<br />
                    <br />
                    #name ----<br />
                    [You hear some footsteps coming your direction]<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Dross #sprite sad<br />
                    Wha? Who’s there?<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Sai #sprite normal<br />
                    Dross? Dross is that you?<br />
                    What are you doing here?<br />
                    <br />
                    #name ----<br />
                    [This is Sai, she works for the shrine of the village. I’ve known her since we were small fry. She’s pretty popular around Umi Village, while I just kept to myself.]<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Dross #sprite normal<br />
                    I can be asking the same of you?<br />
                    #name Dross #sprite happy<br />
                    I’m here to find something that will get me rich.<br />
                    #name Dross #sprite normal<br />
                    Only then would the village finally recognize my worth.<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Sai #sprite sad<br />
                    Do you even know what you’re exactly looking for?<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Dross #sprite blush<br />
                    N-no, not really, just gonna scavenge around and hope I get lucky<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Sai #sprite normal<br />
                    Oh, I see then…<br />
                    Well, I’m just relieved to see you actually moving about outside of your home.<br />
                    #name Sai #sprite sad<br />
                    You would always just stay shut inside your home. And sometimes you would just disappear without any notice, always arriving with a bag full of junk.<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Dross #sprite angry<br />
                    Hey! It’s not junk, they’re trinkets, souvenirs from my visits to the surface world that I go on from time to time.<br />
                    I don’t know what some of them even do yet. But I know this “metal detector” gizmo have here can help me find treasure.<br />
                    #name Dross #sprite normal<br />
                    But you still haven’t answered my question, what are you doing here?<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Sai #sprite sad<br />
                    Oh. Well, you’ve seen all these mysterious objects falling from above right. Some of them have damaged the surrounding areas and are obstructing the environment.<br />
                    #name Sai #sprite normal<br />
                    I’m here on behalf of the shrine to help clean up the mess here.<br />
                    #name Sai #sprite blush<br />
                    Since you’re already out here, I would really appreciate if you could help out. If you don’t mind that is.<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Dross #sprite normal<br />
                    I’m not here to do charity work, I’m here to find something useful.<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Sai #sprite sad<br />
                    Oh, I see then.<br />
                    Well, I’ll leave you to your work then.<br />
                    #name Sai #sprite blank<br />
                    [She leaves with the other Fish Folk of the shrine to start collecting the trash in the surrounding area]<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Dross #sprite normal<br />
                    ….<br />
                    Ok, back to treasure hunting.<br />
                    I see the lights on this gadget change depending on how close I get to certain objects.<br />
                    There’s too much junk in the way though, it’s interfering with the metal detector.<br />
                    I need to do something about them.<br />
                    <br />

                    <h2>Level 1 End</h2><br />
                    #name Dross #sprite angry<br />
                    After clearing out the entire area, I still couldn’t find anything valuable.<br />
                    But I was so sure, something good would’ve been here<br />
                    <br />

                    Hi Dross. I see that you’re still playing treasure hunt I see.<br />
                    <br />
                    #name Dross #sprite normal<br />
                    I ain’t playing or pretending to be a pirate.<br />
                    But even after searching the perimeter, this area is bust.<br />
                    #name Dross #sprite angry<br />
                    No jewels, no gems, gold, nothing.<br />

                    ….<br />
                    Hey Sai, by any chance, you don’t know anywhere else that may be polluted right?<br />

                    I think I’ve seen the objects fall near the Seaweed Forest and Coral Reef.<br />
                    We’re still cleaning the areas near the village, so if you want to help-<br />
                    <br />

                    Yeah, no thanks.<br />

                    I guess if there’s one thing I admire about you; it is your passion once you make up your mind.<br />
