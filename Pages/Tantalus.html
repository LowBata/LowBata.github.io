                        A 3d platformer in collaboration with a group as an exercise in Level Desing. The game was developed in Godot 4 and utilizes the 3d
                        platform starter pack from Kenney and Cyclops Level Editor tools.

                        <br />

                        A gargantuan tree bearing a single special fruit. The architecture in and around the tree is uninviting,
                        dangerous, and isn’t hostile so much as apathetic towards the player. Fallen rotten fruit litters the ground.

                        <br />

                        The player is but one of many who’ve tried to claim the tree’s fruit, and more homely derelict camps
                        can occasionally be spotted around the more desolate architecture long a go built into the tree.

                        <br />

                        <h2>Goal</h2>
                        As the main programmer and the most familiar with Godot, my main priority in this project was to code and design
                        the camera and movement, as well as my section of the level. This is a group project with 2 other members. Everyone
                        contributed to the overall level design, each with distinct goals in mind for our respective sections.

                        <br />

                        <h2>Development</h2>
                        For this project, I wanted to use  Godot to get practice in developing within the engine. To start, I used a 3D Platformer
                        Starter Kit developed by Kenney. This provided code and an example scene. It contains basic movement, jumping mechanics, a
                        checkpoint system, and a coin system, but the camera controls need to be reworked as it didn’t have mouse controls. Instead
                        it used arrow keys to move and tilt the camera. I dedicated time to make new code on top of the player controller to allow the
                        option to switch between arrow controls and mouse controls for movement.

                        <br /><br />

                        Next, I installed and incorporated the Cyclops Level Builder tool from Mark McKay. It was a sufficient level editor that
                        made blocking out levels easily. It allows us to create basic chapes and evenly spaced levels. To get the physics right,
                        we were required to create a metric gym. I created a level with various sized blocks and gaps in order to gauge the feel
                        for the proper design of our levels.

                        <br /><br />

                        We wanted to tell a narrative through level and environment design. The game opens up with the player in a burrow,
                        slowly rising up from it with a view of a fruit hanging on the tree, signifying the goal. There are empty tents throughout
                        the level, showing that others have tried to venture up the tree but have either failed or gave up. Upon mounting the tree,
                        there are no checkpoints placed, letting the player to place them themselves, showing that they are trailblazers on this
                        adventure. The name “Tantalus” was chosen to entice those to a worthy prize but is barely out of reach.

                        <br /><br />

                        Our game was comprised of three levels set around a tree. The first part was the base of the tree to establish the
                        movement and setting. The second part was within a series of buildings next to the tree, to test the player’s spatial
                        movement. The third part, which I was in charge of designing, was around the tree, from the middle and up to the top where
                        the goal lies. The main idea around my level was give a sense of height to where the player is jumping as they are maneuvering
                        around a large tree.

                        <br /><br />
                        <img src="../TantalusImages/LevelDrawing.jpg" />

                        <br /><br />

                        We employed several level design techniques with different emphasis and focuses on each parts.
                        The first part used shapes and positioning of specific objects to guide the player’s attention to move towards the tree.
                        The second part was set inside buildings, so my group member used ideas like windows to focus attention and made spaces open
                        to gauge player’s curiosity. My level used height, depth, contrasting colors, and elevation to balance the sense of anxiety. We
                        also sprinkled coins at integral parts of the map to guide players in more complex segments of the game.

                        <br /><br />

                        My group had some issues when it come to using the editor as it took some time to get used to the tools and
                        features and how things worked. Once we finished our levels, I compiled the three parts into one big scene to make
                        sure the game flowed with cohesion. During playtests, we adjusted our levels to fix some notable issues such as lack of
                        sense of direction in the beginning, the inconsistency of difficulty between the second and third parts, lack of shadows that
                        make it hard to gauge distance, and minor spacing fixes.
