                    Tantalus is a game project in collaboration with other people as an exercise of 3D level design. We wanted to intergrate environmental storytelling in the level design
                    to show an underlying narrative throughout the game. The game is broken up into 3 sections, each section being worked on by 1 person. Even though we worked on different
                    sections of the level, we discussed and planned a goal to illustrate the story of the game, which gave us good direction to work off on.

                    A level design analysis for the Beacon Level of Titanfall 2. Through analyzing the design elements of the level and breaking down its strutcture,
                    I try my best to showcase the thought processes and story that is displayed through playing the level.
