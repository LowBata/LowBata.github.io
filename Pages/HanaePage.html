                    <p>
                        A top down 2d pixel art game where you play as Hanae, a royal flower picker,
                        sent to a village in need of flowers. Help the villagers with their requests,
                        rejuvenate the land, and save the village from its fate. The gameplay is simple,
                        roam around, plant seeds, and pick up flowers. Each villager has their own story that unfolds throughout the days.


                        <br /><br />

                        <h2>Goal</h2>
                        My main priority in this game is narrative design, 
                        story writing, and character design. This is my first game to have a lite quest system, 
                        each villager having a unique personality and a new quest each day. Through playing the levels, it showcases
                        character arcs for each character and progression of the story.

                        <br /><br />
