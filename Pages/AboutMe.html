                    <p>
                        As a passionate game developer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from CSU Channel Islands and a
                        Master's degree in Games and Playable Media from UC Santa Cruz,
                        I've honed my skills in programming, design, art, and narrative development. While my professional experience is limited,
                        I've gained valuable hands-on experience through personal projects, class assignments, and game jams. I have experience working as
                        a solo developer wearing many hats to collaborating in teams, working as a designated role.
                        <br /><br />

                        My technical expertise includes proficiency in Unity, Unreal, and Godot game engines, as well as programming languages like C#, C++,
                        Python, and GDscript. I've also developed artistic skills using Aseprite and Medibang for pixel art and traditional
                        drawing respectively.Beyond programming, I've explored roles in level design, writing, and narrative design, crafting engaging
                        stories and immersive worlds.

                        <br /><br />

                        Driven by a love for storytelling and the intersection of art and technology, I aspire to create games that resonate
                        with players on both emotional and intellectual levels. My goal is to develop games with compelling narratives, diverse and
                        engaging characters, and fun gameplay that helps elevate the experience.

                        <br /><br />

                        I also have a keen interest in AI, I've explored the potential of generative AI and LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini to
                        enhance game design and storytelling. I believe these tools can be harnessed ethically to create more dynamic and engaging
                        experiences. By leveraging AI to generate realistic dialogue, create unique characters, and adapt gameplay to player choices,
                        we can foster a sense of immersion and unpredictability. However, it's crucial to approach AI development with careful consideration
                        of ethical implications, ensuring that these tools are used responsibly to avoid biases, maintain player agency,
                        and protect creative integrity.
