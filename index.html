                        Players can roll for more gacha-mons and use said gacha-mons in a turn-based battle system. The reward for
                        winning a battle against an enemy NPC is coins which can be used for more rolls, making for a simple yet effective gameplay loop

                        A gargantuan tree bearing a single special fruit. The architecture in and around the tree is uninviting,
                        dangerous, and isn’t hostile so much as apathetic towards the player. Fallen rotten fruit litters the ground.
                        The player is but one of many who’ve tried to claim the tree’s fruit, and more homely derelict camps can occasionally
                        be spotted around the more desolate architecture long a go built into the tree.
