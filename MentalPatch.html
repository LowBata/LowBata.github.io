                        **A 2D Text-Based Simulator** where you take on the role of a therapist.
                        You talk with digital NPC patients who have their own problems.
                        The goal is to say the correct things to raise their Emotional Level meter.
                        The player wins the game by getting their patient's Emotional Level meter to 100, achieving happiness for the patient.
                        Through this game, you'll learn about empathy and the importance of mental health.

                        <h2>Goal</h2>
                        I'm fascinated by the ethical and innovative uses of Generative AI and Large Language Models in game design.
                        I love talking with AI chatbots and roleplaying, so I decided to combine the two with a Serious Game element.
                        This project was a personal exercise in integrating LLMs (specifically Gemini) into a game developed in Godot.
                        <br /><br />

                        <h2>Development</h2>
                        The game was designed in Godot 4. I've always had a fondness for Godot and would take any chance I can get to develop games in it.
                        The LLM model used for this game is Gemini 1.5 Pro. It's integrated into the game code via URL requests.
                        I personally love using Gemini out of the major LLMs available because of how creative it can get with responses, as well as its great memory retention, something most LLMs have struggled with.
                        In order for the game to work, the user will need a Gemini API key which can be found at this link:
                        <br /><br />
                        <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key">Gemini API Key</a>
                        <br /><br />

                        <br /><br />

                        Once the user applies their Gemini API key, it will be saved locally in the game files. This way, the user won't have to input it every time.
                        The API key is needed so it can be appended every time the LLM API request is sent in the URL. Through this method, it becomes easy to parse requests and responses from Gemini. Here is a screenshot of sending the initial prompt, telling the bot that it will be roleplaying a character with set parameters and that it will need to respond in a JSON format. JSON is essential to making this all work as it makes it easier to store character data like messages and emotions.
                        <br /><br />
                        <img src="MentalPatchImages/CodeScreenshot.PNG" alt="Code Screenshot" />
                        <br /><br />

                        After integrating Gemini into Godot, the next step was to design the game around the experience. I designed 3 distinct patients, each with their own problem and personality that are initialized in the initial prompt sent to the API. The player can choose who they want to interact with. From there, the appropriate UI is displayed so the player can send text responses to the bot, and the message from the bot will be displayed at the bottom. There is a reset button available as there are times that the bot will become unable to respond or process the request. This can be due to fast intervals of messages which can exceed the quota provided by the free version of Gemini, or if the user said something inappropriate that triggers the bot's safety ratings.
                        <br /><br />

                        The win condition is achieved when the player is able to raise the patient's Emotional Level to 100 (Full Meter). The fail condition activates when the player messes up the responses enough times to lower the patient's Emotional Level to 0 (Empty Meter). The visualization of the Emotional Level and the character's expressions give enough feedback and encouragement to pursue a happier ending.
